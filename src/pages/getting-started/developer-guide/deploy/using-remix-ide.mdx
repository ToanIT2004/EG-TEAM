# Using Remix IDE

Setting up and launching a TBRC-20 Token Smart Contract on the VietChain using Remix IDE.

### What is Remix IDE ?

Remix IDE is an open-source web and desktop application that aids in smart contract development, written in Solidity language for the Ethereum blockchain.
It provides a range of tools that help developers write, test, debug, and deploy smart contracts with ease. Some notable features of Remix IDE include.

### Prerequisites

1. Add VietChain in your MetaMask, to add refer to our guide [Add VietChain to Metamask](/docs/getting-started/add-Vietchain)

2. Faucet VietChain coins

### Creating and Deploying TBRC-20 Token on Remix IDE

    - Visit [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

    You'll be greeted with the following screen.

    - Copy the following code and insert it into ```PrimeViet.sol```.

    ```solidity
        // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
        pragma solidity >=0.5.16 <0.9.0;

        import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
        import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

        contract PrimeViet is ERC20, Ownable {
            constructor() ERC20("PrimeViet", "PRIMEViet") Ownable(msg.sender) {
                _mint(msg.sender, 1000000000 * 10 ** decimals());
            }

            function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
                _mint(to, amount);
            }
        }
    ```

    - Now, click on the "Solidity compiler" icon to go to the compilation tab.
    After that toggle the "Advanced Configurations" dropdown and toggle the "**EVM VERSION**" dropdown menu and select "**paris**" instead of "**default**".

    - Press the "Compile" button to your contract, ensuring you select the checkbox highlighted within the blue circle.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you haven't added the VietChain in your MetaMask, refer to our guide [Add

</Callout>

After clicking the "Deploy" button, MetaMask will pop up prompting you to approve the transaction. Once you confirm, your contract will deploy within a few seconds, and you'll be able to view your deployed contract here.
